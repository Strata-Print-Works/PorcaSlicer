# Test suite rules

Rules for writing tests under `tests/`. [CATCH2.md](CATCH2.md) is the Catch2 reference. Building and running the suites is covered on the wiki, at <https://www.orcaslicer.com/wiki/developer_reference/how_to_test.html>.

## The suites

- `libslic3r`: the core library. Geometry, meshes, file formats, config and presets, Clipper, algorithms, data structures.
- `fff_print`: the FFF slicing pipeline, from a `Model` plus config through `Print` and `PrintObject` to emitted G-code.
- `sla_print`: SLA support-tree and pad geometry, support-point generation, raycast.
- `libnest2d`: 2D nesting and packing.
- `slic3rutils`: GUI/utility behavior, printer-agent fakes, the Python plugin system and its slicing-pipeline bindings. This executable also contains real network tests; never run it unfiltered under the current local restriction.
- `porca_unit`: a lightweight build target reusing selected pure tests from `libslic3r` and `slic3rutils`, with their small production sources. Test ownership remains in those suites; keep their full copies. Do not link `libslic3r` or `libslic3r_gui` into this target.
- `filament_group`: filament-to-extruder grouping, checked against golden files.
- `cli`: end-to-end runs of the built `orca-slicer` binary, Linux only. These tests carry the `RequiresApp` label, which the CI unit-test job excludes because it receives only `build/tests`; run them with `ctest --test-dir build/tests -C Release -L RequiresApp`.

## Building and running

The root [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) owns the current local validation restriction. Use an already configured Release tree with tests enabled (`BUILD_TESTS=ON`) and dependencies available locally:

```sh
python3 scripts/build_porca.py libslic3r_tests slic3rutils_tests porca_unit_tests fff_print_tests
python3 scripts/verify_offline.py all
```

Both commands accept `--build-dir <path>` for a different configured tree. Build only the targets required for the change; `verify_offline.py --list` shows each group's targets and tags. The runner holds the same build lock while testing, uses an isolated temporary working directory for each tag, and reports failures and empty selections. It does not rebuild stale executables.

For the pure subset, use `python3 scripts/build_porca.py porca_unit_tests` then `python3 scripts/verify_offline.py quick`. Camera projection, workspace geometry and project persistence still require the full targets. The lightweight target has prefixed CTest names so it can coexist with the original cases without duplicate registration names.

Do not use the inherited bootstrap/build-and-test scripts or blanket CTest commands under the current restriction: they can download dependencies or run real network tests. Follow [the build guide](../docs/development-builds.md) for offline checks and prerequisites.

Before adding a tag to the runner or extending a listed tag, inspect every matching test, helper, startup hook and production call for real sockets, DNS, HTTP, subprocesses and application startup. A tag name is not a network sandbox. Keep the source references beside the runner's group definitions current. New coverage outside those groups still needs a targeted, inspected run; do not broaden a group to an entire suite.

## Where a test goes

- Pick the suite by the production code the test exercises, not by how the test is written.
- A property of a class that holds with no `Print` involved belongs in `libslic3r`. Behavior that depends on print settings, or produces or consumes G-code or slicing state, belongs in `fff_print`.
- One file per subsystem, named `test_<subsystem>.cpp`. It owns every test for that subsystem, whether the test reads in-memory state or generated output.
- When you add a file, list it in that suite's `CMakeLists.txt` in the same change.

## Use the existing helpers

Check these before writing your own setup or output-parsing code.

- `tests/test_utils.hpp` is shared by every suite. `load_model()` loads a mesh from `tests/data/`, and `ScopedTemporaryFile` gives a temp path that removes itself.
- `fff_print/test_helpers.hpp` builds and slices a `Print` and parses the emitted G-code. Read it before writing an fff_print test rather than assembling a `Print` by hand.
- The other suites have their own: `sla_print/sla_test_utils.hpp`, `libnest2d/libnest2d_test_utils.hpp`, `slic3rutils/plugin_test_utils.hpp`, `filament_group/fg_test_utils.hpp`. `libslic3r` has none and uses the shared header.
- Test data lives in `tests/data/` and is reached through the `TEST_DATA_DIR` define. Wrap it in `std::string(...)` before joining a path onto it.

## Writing the test

- Name the test case as a plain behavioral sentence in the present tense. No `Subsystem:` prefix.
- Tag it with the subsystem it covers, matching the file, in PascalCase. That tag is what people filter on, so every test needs one.
- Add further tags where they help: a narrower one to slice a large file (`[Rotcalip]`, `[Placer]`), a shared one for something spanning files (`[Python]`, `[H2C]`, `[Regression]`), or `[NotWorking]` / `[.]` to disable or hide a test. Say why in a comment if you disable or hide.
- Prefer a flat `TEST_CASE` per behavior, with `GENERATE` for parameterized cases. Reserve `SCENARIO` / `GIVEN` / `WHEN` / `THEN` for genuine shared setup that branches into a few close variations.
- Set the config keys your test depends on, and derive the expected values from what you set. A 20mm cube sliced at `layer_height` 2 is 10 layers, and the test should state both parts. If a number in your assertion comes from a key you never set, the test is also testing that default.
- Assert the defining property, not an incidental value. "Skirt present" or "at least 2 brim loops" survives a refactor; exact coordinates and byte counts do not.
- Name a regression test for the behavior it protects, never for an issue or PR number.
- When asserting on G-code, match the meaningful token such as `; skirt` rather than whole lines, whitespace or comment wording. Depend on ordering only when ordering is the contract.

## Catch2 rules that cause real breakage

- Never reuse a `SECTION` name inside a loop. Use `DYNAMIC_SECTION` so each iteration is unique.
- Never assert from a spawned thread. Catch2 assertions are not thread-safe. Collect results in the thread and assert on the main thread.
- Never combine conditions with `&&` or `||` inside one assertion. Split them so Catch2 can print both operands on failure.
- Compare floats with `WithinAbs` or `WithinRel`, never `==`. Prefer these over `Approx` in new tests.
- Keep tests self-contained: no shared state, green under `--order rand`.
